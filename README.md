# **Visualization of sklearn's trees using networkx and bokeh**

Overview
---

This repository contains an alternative to the usage of GraphViz for the visualization of the rules contained in a decision tree classifier. By using networkx and bokeh, a more powerful visualization method can be used.

The final output of the tree can be found in the `interactive-graphs.html` file or through [this link](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/fsbeserra/treeViz/blob/master/interactive_graphs.html)
